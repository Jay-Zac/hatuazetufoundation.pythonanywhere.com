            <h2 id="Wezesha-Program-view" style="color: #0057E9;">1. Wezesha Program: Inclusive Education for Autistic

            <img src="/media/Other/autism.jpeg" alt="Autistic Children" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-4">
            <p>
                This program is a comprehensive initiative designed to empower and support autistic young people in
                multiple facets of their lives. It encompasses a holistic approach, combining educational programs
                tailored to their specific needs, a well-balanced feeding program to ensure their nutritional
                well-being, robust measures to protect them from violence and exploitation, and comprehensive sexual
                health and rights education to promote their autonomy and safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, it provides essential guidance and resources to parents, helping them improve their
                livelihoods and become better advocates for their children. Moreover, this program aims to transform
                societal perceptions and attitudes towards children with disabilities, fostering inclusion and
                understanding within communities, ultimately creating a more inclusive and accepting environment for
                these exceptional young individuals. Our goal is to create an environment where every child can learn
                and grow.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Hatua-Zetu-Program-view" style="color: #0057E9;">2. Hatua Zetu Program: Campaign and Policy
                Advocacy</h2>
            <img src="/media/Other/advocacy.jpg" alt="Campaign Advocacy" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-4">
            <p>
                The program aims at amplifying the voices of young women and girls in all diversities in policy through
                campaign and policy advocacy. We encourage young women and girlâ€™s participation in decision-making
                spaces and create space for their participation at local and national level. Our primary objectives
                include advocating for policies related to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) and
                combating violence against women, with a specific focus on ending Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).
            </p>
            <p>
                This initiative actively promotes the involvement of young women and girls in the decision-making
                processes, ensuring they have a meaningful role at both local and national levels. By doing so, the
                program seeks to foster inclusivity, gender equality, and a safer environment for women and girls while
                advancing critical policy changes in the realm of SRHR and gender-based violence prevention.

            <h2 id="Udada-na-sanaa-view" style="color: #0057E9;">3. Udada na Sanaa Program: Community Education and
                Awareness Creation</h2>
            <img src="/media/Other/education.jpg" alt="Community Education"
                 class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-4">
            <p>
                We create a safe and inclusive space for all our members to share their stories, experiences, and ideas.
                Through our efforts, we continue to create a strong network and supportive environment for us all to
                grow, change, and create long-lasting positive impacts on our community through art. This program
                harnesses the power of art as a transformative tool to educate the public and challenge oppressive
                notions and systems that undermine women and girls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through a blend of visual, performing, and digital arts, this initiative aims to spark critical
                conversations about gender equality, empowering women, and dismantling harmful stereotypes. We not only
                showcase the resilience and achievements of women and girls but also expose the deep-seated biases and
                injustices they face. By engaging diverse audiences through artistic expression, this program seeks to
                inspire empathy, awareness, and activism, ultimately fostering a society where gender equality is not
                just a dream but a lived reality.

            <img src="/media/Other/climate.jpg" alt="Climate Justice" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-4">
            <p>
                This program is dedicated to elevating the voices of women and girls in our communities who bear the
                heaviest burdens of climate change impacts, yet have made the smallest contributions to the climate
                crisis. Specifically, we create spaces for educating communities on the most effective solutions that
                begin with safeguarding their land, waterways, and other vital natural resources. We nurture creators
                and advocates on innovative climate solutions including protecting and disseminating indigenous wisdom
                and policy advocacy.
